# The Impact of Model Architecture on Analysis of Graph Data

### This is the implementation of the 5 models we have used for the project, the dataset, and some of the results from CNN and GNN models.

### This code is easy to use but requires setting the environment to run (refer to requirements.txt).

### train.bash file will run the GNN implementation and others are implemented in the Jupyter Notebook files under main.
